**Commit:** 84330980ab72e0ac2f59ebafe82ebf50a47715b1

## Summary

This commit adds a new RFD document `RFD-20260121-ad21fc5-anvil-review.md` that records the automated anvil (Codex) review of commit ad21fc5. The reviewed commit ad21fc5 added a hammer review RFD for commit ea711ab.

**Files changed:** `docs/rfd/RFD-20260121-ad21fc5-anvil-review.md` (12 lines added)

## Findings

### 1. LOW: Anvil review finding critique may overcorrect

**Severity:** Low
**Location:** `docs/rfd/RFD-20260121-ad21fc5-anvil-review.md:9`

The anvil review finding states:
> The finding labeled "Summary references incorrect file path" is inaccurate because the referenced path is valid, and the text immediately notes it is technically accurate, creating a contradiction in the review narrative

While the anvil review correctly identifies that the hammer review's finding acknowledged the reference was "technically accurate," the hammer review's concern was about clarity, not accuracy. The hammer review explicitly noted the reference "could be clearer about the chain of reviews" (`docs/rfd/RFD-20260121-ea711ab-hammer-review.md:21`). The anvil review's characterization of this as a "contradiction" is itself slightly overstated since noting something is accurate but confusing is not contradictory.

### 2. INFO: Documentation-only change with appropriate brevity

**Severity:** Informational
**Location:** `docs/rfd/RFD-20260121-ad21fc5-anvil-review.md:1-12`

The RFD is appropriately concise for a documentation-only commit. The file follows the established RFD format with:
- Title with "Anvil Review" designation and commit short SHA
- Commit reference line (full SHA)
- Summary section
- Findings section with one low-severity item
- Recommended actions section

### 3. INFO: No code changes or security concerns

**Severity:** Informational

This commit introduces no executable code changes, no configuration modifications, and no security-relevant alterations. The change is strictly documentation within the `docs/rfd/` directory.

## Recommended Actions

1. **No immediate action required** - The RFD document is well-formed and the finding it raises is a reasonable observation about review consistency, even if the characterization could be more nuanced.

2. **Consider acceptance of minor stylistic variance in reviews** - Both hammer and anvil reviews operate on subjective interpretation of clarity and accuracy. The meta-review chain naturally produces these differences in perspective, which is acceptable.
