# RFD: Anvil Review ad21fc5

- Commit: ad21fc590a1595038a9adac567d4c5297de9a840

## Summary
- Adds a hammer review RFD for ea711ab that documents the anvil review of 1f8ee74 (`docs/rfd/RFD-20260121-ea711ab-hammer-review.md:1`).

## Findings
- Low: The finding labeled "Summary references incorrect file path" is inaccurate because the referenced path is valid, and the text immediately notes it is technically accurate, creating a contradiction in the review narrative (`docs/rfd/RFD-20260121-ea711ab-hammer-review.md:13`).

## Recommended actions
- Revise the finding wording to reflect the actual ambiguity (anvil vs. hammer review) or remove the finding if no correction is required.
